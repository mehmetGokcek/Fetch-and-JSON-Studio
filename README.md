# Fetch-and-JSON-Studio
My object was to build a website that shows astronauts fetched from an external API.


When fetching data in JavaScript, the HTTP requests are asynchronous. 
In brief, that means when an HTTP request is sent, we don't know exactly when a response will be received by the browser. 
Remember that HTTP requests are sent to an address, then a response is sent. 
That process takes a variable amount of time depending on network speed, the address location, and response size.
